# Citadel
It's 2-7 players card game. Complete instruction can be found [here](https://www.fgbradleys.com/rules/rules2/Citadels-rules.pdf).
Basic logic has been finished and game can run as simulation. Now I'm trying to figure out what will be the best way to make it playable with GUI.

## Built With
* [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8-whats-new-2157071.html) - Core Language
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) - For @Getters and @Setters annotations

## About
Thanks to this project I'm able to practice OOP and clean code rules. Hopefully after some time it will grow bigger. It's obvious that I make mistakes - feel free to inform me about them under: vesperon[at]o2.pl
